		<ul>
			<li>How long have you been taking photographs?<p>I started taking photographs at 2009. My first camera was Zenit ET which I bought from my friend.</p></li>
			<li>Why do you take photographs? What are you looking to get out of it?<p>I'm taking photos because I am enthralled by the process. You never fully know what pictures you will turn out, you need to wait until you finish roll of film, you need to develop film and scan it. Sometimes I like waiting more than what I get in the end) I take photos because I want to capture not so much a place or object, but what I feel this moment. I try it and I hope. I'm trying do that, and I hope that I get it.</p></li>
			<li>Do you self develop or get a lab to process your film?<p>I processed the films in lab at several years. At 2011 I tried to develop BW film and it was much easier than I thought and since then I've been developing it. Colour film I processed since march 14. It's so easy too and I'll not develop my C-41 films in lab.</p></li>
			<li>What first interested you in analog photography?<p>Ambiance. Awesome ambiance.</p></li>
			<li>What is your favourite piece of equipment (camera, film, or other) and
why?<p>My favourite camera is Pentax K-1000. It's so cheap, simple and reliable.
I like Pentax 6x7 too but K-1000 more compact and weighs less). Favourite lens
is SMC Pentax 67 / <a id="hidden" href="game.php">Takumar</a> 6x7 105mm F2.4 - bokeh, sharp, solid.</p></li>
			<li>Do you have a favourite analog photographer or analog photography web site you would like to recommend?<p>I subscribe to someone on Fickr. But I can't name my favorite photographer.</p></li>
			<li>Is there anything else you would like to add about yourself or your photography?<p>I'm just doing what I like. I do it not for money, fame or likes. I do it because I take a delight in it. And everyone who read it, I wish the same.
Best regards!</p></li>
